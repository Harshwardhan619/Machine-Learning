Task 3:
	OPtimal parameters:
Ridge Regression:
		Learning_rate	:	0.00001
		Max_Iteration	:	30000
		Lambda_Used		:	12
		K				:	6

Task 5:

Unusual observtions in weights in Lasso:
	Some weights component obtained from Lasso are zero. i.e those component of dataset is not contributing anything to the test result. 
	The contour of the original sse function tends to cut the the countour of the L1 norm at the corner points which are on the axis. Thus componentscan be zero.
	But in ridge regression, no component of weight is zero unless all are zero.


Is using lasso advantageous?
	Lasso can be advantageous as its some component is zero. I.e it discard less important features and use more important featues. While ridge regression doen't do it.
